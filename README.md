## About

Markus Enzweiler, markus.enzweiler@hs-esslingen.de

This repository contains some Jupyter notebooks used in my lectures at Esslingen University of Applied Sciences. It mainly uses PyTorch (https://pytorch.org/). Some parts are also available for MLX (https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx). 

**Feel free to use and contribute via pull requests.**
