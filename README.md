# Computer Vision and Machine Learning Jupyter Notebooks

## About

Markus Enzweiler, markus.enzweiler@hs-esslingen.de

This repository contains some Jupyter notebooks used in my lectures at Esslingen University of Applied Sciences. 

It mainly uses PyTorch (https://pytorch.org/). Some parts are also available for MLX (https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx). 

**Feel free to use and contribute via pull requests.** 

## Contents

* `autograd`: demo of automatic differentiation in PyTorch and MLX
* `linear_regression`: demo of linear regression in PyTorch and MLX
* `perceptron`: multiple demos of perceptrons in NumPy, PyTorch and MLX. Some of the demos are very "spelled-out" to provide some insights into the inner working of gradient descent
* `multi_layer_perceptron`: multiple demos of multi-layer perceptrons in PyTorch and MLX
