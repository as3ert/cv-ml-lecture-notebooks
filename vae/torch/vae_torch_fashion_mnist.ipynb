    "In our implementation, the input image is not directly mapped to a single latent vector. Instead, it's transformed into a probability distribution within the latent space, from which we sample a latent vector for reconstruction. The process involves:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Encoding to Probability Distribution**: \n",
    "   - The input image is linearly mapped to two vectors: \n",
    "     - A **mean vector**.\n",
    "     - A **standard deviation vector**.\n",
    "   - These vectors define a normal distribution in the latent space.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Auxiliary Loss for Distribution Shape**: \n",
    "   - We ensure the latent space distribution resembles a zero-mean unit-variance Gaussian distribution (standard normal distribution).\n",
    "   - An auxiliary loss, the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the mapped distribution and the standard normal distribution, is used in addition to the standard reconstruction loss\n",
    "   - This loss guides the training to shape the latent distribution accordingly.\n",
    "   - It ensures a well-structured and generalizable latent space for generating new images.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Sampling and Decoding**: \n",
    "   - The variational approach allows for sampling from the defined distribution in the latent space.\n",
    "   - These samples are then used by the decoder to generate new images.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Reparametrization Trick**:\n",
    "   - This trick enables backpropagation through random sampling, a crucial step in VAEs. Normally, backpropagating through a random sampling process from a distribution with mean ```mu``` and standard deviation ```sigma``` is challenging due to its nondeterministic nature.\n",
    "   - The solution involves initially sampling random values from a standard normal distribution (mean 0, standard deviation 1). These values are then linearly transformed by multiplying with ```sigma``` and adding ```mu```. This process essentially samples from our target distribution with mean ```mu``` and standard deviation ```sigma```.\n",
    "   - The key benefit of this approach is that the randomness (initial standard normal sampling) is separated from the learnable parameters (```mu``` and ```sigma```). ```Mu``` and ```sigma``` are deterministic and differentiable, allowing gradients with respect to them to be calculated during backpropagation. This enables the model to effectively learn from the data."
